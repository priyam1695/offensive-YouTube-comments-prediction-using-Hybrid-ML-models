Detection of offensive YouTube comments, a performance comparison of Deep Learning approaches

•	Predictive analysis of comments dataset. Preprocessing involved removing stopwords, punctuations, duplicated letters and numbers. 
Stemming and lemmatization on the words using natural language processing tools.
•	The problem of imbalance in data corrected by using different sampling techniques such as Random Over Sampling, Random Under Sampling, SMOTE and Stratified K-fold
•	Deep Learning models (CNN, CNN-LSTM, LSTM and LSTM-CNN) compared to find out which method works better on the text classification by considering Recall as the performance metric
•	Found out that Hybrid models work well when SMOTE sampling Technique is used in detecting offensive comments by giving better predictions percentage 
removing underfitting and overfitting problem.
